# Field 385: Smart Grid Demand Response Game — Research & Engineering Notes

## 1. Domain Theoretical Foundations & Governing Equations
This research module formalizes the mathematical principles, state-space formulations, and computational models for **Smart Grid Demand Response Game**.

### 1.1 State-Space Dynamics & Governing Laws
The fundamental dynamic state vector $\mathbf{x}(t)$ and boundary equations governing this domain are defined as:
$$\dot{\mathbf{x}}(t) = \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x}(t), \mathbf{u}(t), t) + \mathbf{w}(t)$$
$$\mathbf{y}(t) = \mathbf{h}(\mathbf{x}(t)) + \mathbf{v}(t)$$

Where:
- $\mathbf{x}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^n$: State trajectory (e.g. concentrations, potential fields, kinematic manifolds).
- $\mathbf{u}(t) \in \mathbb{R}^m$: Control inputs / driving potentials.
- $\mathbf{w}(t), \mathbf{v}(t)$: Stochastic disturbance and observation noise tensors.

### 1.2 Invariant Constraints & Conservation Principles
All implementations in this laboratory satisfy empirical conservation constraints:
$$\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} + \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} = 0, \quad \mathcal{L}(\mathbf{q}, \dot{\mathbf{q}}) = T - V$$
